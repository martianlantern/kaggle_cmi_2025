# kaggle_cmi_2025

This is our solution to the kaggle [cmi behavior detection with sensor data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data), we ranked 271st on the Public LB. We started just 2 days before the competition and thus the repo is not documented, the code here is brittle and fragile, it will break if used without the understanding of the entire codebase. Use it with caution

```
uv run kaggle competitions download -c cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data

uv run 1D_CNN.py
```
